# Project Contributions

If you want to contribute to this project, that's great!

Start by opening an issue. Name it something like 'Proposal: IDEA', or 'Enhancement: IDEA'. The administrators of the project can review it. When you get the go-ahead, create the enhancement and submit a PR. Here are some rules to follow

1. Either use the `develop` branch or create your own.
2. Create the PR to merge in to `develop`, or create the branch on the base repo. Do _not_ create a PR that will merge in to `master`.
3. Try to follow the same commit messaging template as I use: `path/to/file - Cool enhancment`.

The PR will then go through review, There are a couple of things we are looking for:

1. That the PR passes all the tests and CIs.
2. That there is as little code needed for a user to impliment the feature as possible.

If either of these fail, they will need to be fixed before the PR is accepted.

Have fun!
